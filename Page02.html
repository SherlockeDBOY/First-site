                <h2>HARLEY DAVIDSON</h2>
                <p>Harley-Davidson, Inc., H-D, or Harley, is an American motorcycle manufacturer founded in 1903 in 
                    Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Along with Indian, it was one of two major American motorcycle manufacturers
                    to survive the Great Depression. The company has survived numerous ownership arrangements, 
                    subsidiary arrangements, periods of poor economic health and product quality, and intense global competition
                    to become one of the world's largest motorcycle manufacturers and an iconic brand widely known for its 
                    loyal following. There are owner clubs and events worldwide, as well as a company-sponsored, brand-focused museum.<br>
                    Harley-Davidson is noted for a style of customization that gave rise to the chopper motorcycle style. The company traditionally marketed heavyweight, air-cooled cruiser motorcycles with engine displacements greater than 700 cc, but it has broadened its offerings to include more contemporary VRSC (2002) and middle-weight Street (2015) platforms.
                    <br>
                    Harley-Davidson manufactures its motorcycles at factories in York, Pennsylvania;
                    Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Kansas City, Missouri (closed May 2019); Manaus, Brazil; and Bawal, India. 
                    Construction of a new plant in Thailand began in late 2018. The company markets its products worldwide, 
                    and also licenses and markets merchandise under the Harley-Davidson brand, among them apparel, 
                    home d√©cor and ornaments, accessories, toys, scale models of its motorcycles, 
                    and video games based on its motorcycle line and the community.</p>
